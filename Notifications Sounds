Notifications Sounds


1. To play the default system sound, we can create our sound object using the default method.

2. To add a custom sound file for our app, It should not be more than 30 seconds according to Apple standards.
We can package the audio data in an aiff, wav format for the notification sound. I convert my sound file to .caf (Core Audio File Format) file.
we can add our custom sound using UNNotificationSound with the name of your file.
