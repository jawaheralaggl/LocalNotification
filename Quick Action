Quick Action

By pressing an app icon, the user obtains a set of quick actions. When the user selects a quick action to immediately access 
functionality provided by your app, Your app activates or launches and your app delegate object receives the quick action message.


Types:
1. We can define static quick actions in our appâ€™s Info.plist file in the UIApplicationShortcutItems array.
2. We can define dynamic quick actions with the UIApplicationShortcutItem class. Then add it by using the new shortcutItems property.

Both types of quick action can display up to two lines of text along with an optional icon.
Both of UIApplicationShortcutItemType & UIApplicationShortcutItemTitle keys are required.
